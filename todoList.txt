- Make the restaurant page with tabs to change between the contact and menu:

    - Each tab should be in his own module that exports a function that creates 
    a div element adds the respetive content and style to that element and appends to DOM

    - The tab switching logic should be inside index.js. It should have event listeners
    for each tab to clean the current content and display the new tab content.
